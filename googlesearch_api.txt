Scenario: Sample GET request
    When I perform the following step:
      """
      I send a GET request to "typicode.com/posts"
      """
    Then the response status should be "200"

  Scenario: POST request with params
    When I perform the following step with table:
      """
      I send a POST request to "typicode.com/posts" with the following:
      | userId | 1 |
      | id | 1  |
      """
    Then the response status should be "201"

Step Defs:

When /^I perform the following steps?:$/ do |step_strings|
  steps = step_strings.split("\n")
  steps.each {|step_string| step step_string }
end

Then /^the response should equal:$/ do |response_body|
  expect(last_response.body).to eq(response_body)
end
